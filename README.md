# Crypto Coin Swapper Using Polygon [Curve.fi](https://polygon.curve.fi/)
The aim of this project is to familiarize ourselves with creating a simple program in Python. We are going to swap [$USDC](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x2791bca1f2de4661ed88a30c99a7a9449aa84174) to [$axlUSDC](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x750e4c4984a9e0f12978ea6742bc1c5d248f40ed) with the amount that we will input.
